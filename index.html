					<h2>Charles Schwab Trading Tools Demo</h2>
					<p class="title">The Assignment:</p>
					<p>Build a demo people will actually engage with that highlights how much better Schwab’s trading platforms are than the competition. Since the existing demos out there are flat and uninspired, this is an opportunity to not only create relevant conversations with prospects, but also establish Schwab as the “best in class” trading platform demo.</p>
					<p class="title">The Project: </p>
					<p>The new demo experience is customizable, immersive, and unlike any other online platform demo. The viewer follows afictional trader—with similar experience and habits as their own—through a typical trading day on Schwab’s platforms.By focusing on the trader, not the tools, we have a more relevant conversation with prospects about “human-poweredtrading”, deepening engagement and pushing them towards conversion.</p>
					<p class="title">The Results:</p>
					<p>Amongst the initial unique visitors, participation rate with traffic to the demo was more than double the highest-measuring comparable video experience on the Schwab website. <br><br>Even more impressive, nearly 9% of all visitors were motivated to click the “Open an Account” overlay. </p>

						<h2>QuickBooks Online Banner Campaign</h2>
						<p class="title">The Assignment:</p>
						<p>Create a banner ad campaign targeting product-based businesses that highlights how the features of QuickBooks canhelp them better manage their business by tracking sales, managing inventory, and stay prepared for tax time—inaddition to the accounting functionality—all in one tool. </p>
						<p class="title">The Project:</p>
						<p>One of several campaigns chosen to execute, this series quickly tells an easy-to-follow story about how QuickBooks can be used at each stage of the business lifecycle—from production to sales. In just a few frames, we showcase not just the features, but how those translate into tangible benefits.</p>
