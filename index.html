					<h2>Charles Schwab Trading Tools Demo</h2>
					<p class="title">The Assignment:</p>
					<p>Build a demo people will actually engage with that highlights how much better Schwab’s trading platforms are than the competition. Since the existing demos out there are flat and uninspired, this is an opportunity to not only create relevant conversations with prospects, but also establish Schwab as the “best in class” trading platform demo.</p>
					<p class="title">The Project: </p>
					<p>The new demo experience is customizable, immersive, and unlike any other online platform demo. The viewer follows afictional trader—with similar experience and habits as their own—through a typical trading day on Schwab’s platforms.By focusing on the trader, not the tools, we have a more relevant conversation with prospects about “human-poweredtrading”, deepening engagement and pushing them towards conversion.</p>
					<p class="title">The Results:</p>
					<p>Amongst the initial unique visitors, participation rate with traffic to the demo was more than double the highest-measuring comparable video experience on the Schwab website. <br><br>Even more impressive, nearly 9% of all visitors were motivated to click the “Open an Account” overlay. </p>

				<h1>How to do more with less</h1>
				<p>Given the challenging economic times over the past few years, it’s not hard to believe that the majority of us have most likely been tasked to do more with less: less money, less time, less resources. The reality is that the work still needs to get done, both quickly and at a high caliber.</p>
				<p>So how is this possible? Here are a few strategies we use at Third Rail:</p>

				<div class="insight">
					<div class="insight-num"><span>1</span></div>
					<div class="insight-tip">
						<header>Define the wins upfront.</header>
						<p>Identifying the primary goals before starting helps keep everyone laser-focused on what really matters through the end goal.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="insight">
					<div class="insight-num"><span>2</span></div>
					<div class="insight-tip">
						<header>Avoid being trapped by routine.</header>
						<p>While a defined process is extremely important, the ability to be flexible and realign to changing priorities is equally vital.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="insight">
					<div class="insight-num"><span>3</span></div>
					<div class="insight-tip">
						<header>Uncover hidden talents.</header>
						<p>Encouraging everyone to be collaborative and not think of themselves as a single-function cog in a machine helpsunleash the full potential of employees and their contributions. In other words, creative ideas don’t just come from the creative department.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Doing more with less requires strategic sorting of priorities up front but also presents a unique opportunity to develop smart,proactive, innovative teams—and ultimately leads to a better foundation for success given the limited time, budget, andresources available.</p>

				<h1>3 questions with developer extraordinaire, Aaron Case</h1>
				<div class="aarons-pic"></div>

				<div class="spotlight-questions">
					<div class="question">
						<header>What’s your favorite thing about working at 3RC?</header>
						<p>I enjoy the ability to collaborateand brainstorm with other team members.  It doesn't matter that I'm not a writer, or a designer, or an account team member. If I have an idea, I know that it's going to be heard and addressed. It keeps us close as a team, and it leads to stronger work.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<header>As a developer, what’s the most interesting site you’ve come across recently?</header>
						<p>The coolest site I've come across recently is Metrocosm’s US Immigration History Map. It's a time lapse of US immigration over the last two centuries, and it combines my two nerdiest passions: Data and Geography. It's really interesting to see how diverse we are as a county, and it's a lot of fun to see the migration patterns over time.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<header>What’s your favorite thing about living in Austin?</header>
						<p>That would have to be the endless sources of entertainment. If you're bored in this city, you haven't tried enough. I can wake up on the weekends and go for a hike, then make my way to some delicious food spot, grab a craft beer that I've never heard of, make my way to a show in the early evening, and then finish out my day at a swimming hole with my friends. You can't do that in most places, and it's why Austin's been my adoptive home for the last 6 years.</p>
